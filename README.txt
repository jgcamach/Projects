# Research Examples and Projects

This repository contains R and Python projects analyzing economic and mathematical problems alongside projects that illustrate my coding capabilities.

- **Website Production Efficiency:** Econometric analysis of website production time using R.
    Note that this code is from my beginnings in using R so the organizational structure is not as refined as the proceeding projects.
- **Deposit Insurance Experiment:** Behavioral economics experiment using data from Veconlab data in R.
- **Steam Webscraper:** Python script collecting data on top-selling games.
- **Goalie Save Simulation:** Simulating striker shots and the finding the best goalie position. 
    Also see https://www.desmos.com/geometry/cgv9fxka9x for a visualized model of the same problem. It's definitely worth a look.
- **Mutual Fund Analysis:** Analyzing a mutual fund using time series analysis in R.
